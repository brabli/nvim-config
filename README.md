# Neovim Configuration

There are a million nvim-config repos on GitHub, but this one is special because it is mine. Besides, I needed a way to copy my config around on different computers.

I shall continue to edit and update it as I learn more about vim, neovim and neovim config in general.


# Installation

Backup your existing config first if you don't want to lose it.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/brabli/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
